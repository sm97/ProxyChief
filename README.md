**This proxy is made to be the very best, and is super lightweight.**

**_Access using any of these [URLs](/ListOfInstances.txt)_**

Format for entries: `protocol://domain:port/`

`protocol` is `http` or `https`.

`domain` is the domain (subdomains count as their own different domain) or IP.

`port` is the port it is running (make a new entry for each port).

---

Run your own instance:

Run `wget -O proxychief.zip https://github.com/youngchief-btw/ProxyChief/archive/master.zip` (I recommend doing `git clone https://github.com/youngchief-btw/ProxyChief.git` instead to pull in the latest changes)
